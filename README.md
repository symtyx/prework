## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Casting numbers proved to be arduous in Swift, many fields are weakly typed and Swift requires casting to be strongly typed, hence a rabbithole into the ! operator that solved my frustrations.
